Example implementations of some classification models in machine learning

## This repository contains examples for implementing the following machine learning classification models:
+ Logistic Regression
+ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
+ Support Vector Machine (SVM)
+ Kernel SVM
+ Naive Bayes
+ Decision Tree Classification
+ Random Forest Classification
+ Random Forest Classification

When a predicted *value* is *not* what we are after, we may be needing to predict a *category*. This is where classification models come in.
